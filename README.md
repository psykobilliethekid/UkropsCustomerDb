##Ukrop's Customer Database

A customer database completed for my programming test as a Junior Applications Developer for a local business. 

###Sections of the site
- Home Page - opening page with start blurb (will make better before turning in)
- About page (reason for creating the site - still need to fill this in)
- Customers Page - shows list of customers in teh database
- Add a Customer - adds a customer to the database
- Edit / Delete Customer Information - edit an existing customer's information or delete an existing customer

Site runs with a SQL Server Express database that (hopefully!) should be included and deploy with the project when opened.

Hope to add on Bootstrap to the site before I turn everything in.
